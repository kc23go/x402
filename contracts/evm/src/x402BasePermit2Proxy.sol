/**
 * @title x402BasePermit2Proxy
 * @notice Abstract base contract for x402 payments using Permit2
 *
 * @dev This contract provides the shared logic for x402 payment proxies.
 *      It acts as the authorized spender in Permit2 signatures and uses the
 *      "witness" pattern to cryptographically bind the payment destination,
 *      preventing facilitators from redirecting funds.
 *
 *      The Permit2 address is passed as a constructor argument and stored as
 *      an immutable. Since Permit2 is deployed via a deterministic CREATE2
 *      deployer, its canonical address (0x000000000022D473030F116dDEE9F6B43aC78BA3)
 *      is the same on all EVM chains. Using the same constructor argument on
 *      every chain keeps the initCode identical, preserving a uniform CREATE2
 *      address for these proxies across all chains.
